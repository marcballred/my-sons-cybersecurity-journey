# my-sons-cybersecurity-journey
The steps I'm taking to help my son succeed in the field of cybersecurity.

I'm Marc Allred and I have a son who is interested in cybersecurity and I'm doing my best to mentor him to be successful in this field, even though I'm not a practitioner. 

The strategy I'm currently working on with him before he graduates high school is:

- complete high schools cybersecurity path, acquiring the CompTIA certs along the way.
- complete Google Cybersecurity Certificate.
  *when he does, he gets to choose between either an iPhone or a beginners hacker laptop as a reward
- go to hacker conferences like BSides in Delaware (done), Districtcon (couldn't get tickets, but tried to volunteer), and eventually take him to DEFCON.
  *goal is to meet as many friends and participate in the community and find "his people."
- start building his GitHub.
- Complete 2-3 CTFs or ethical hacker projects and then document the process in his GitHub.
- Complete as many more certificates as possible from coursera.org, taking breaks between certificates to practice CTF competitions and documenting the progress.
- Items to document after each certificate
  *what he learned
  *commands & tools used
  *screenshots or descriptions of mini projects
- Items to document after each CTF
  *What the challenge was
  *How he approached it
  *Commands or tools used
  *What he learned

## What you'll find here

- Successes and struggles
*it was impossible to get him motivated until I started offering "incentives" that spoke to his teenage brain like status symbols (iphone/hacker laptop). He really got involved then.
- Questions or concerns 
- Recommendations for anyone else considering mentoring their son, when you have no idea what you're doing
